Very simple unix C/C++ Project Generator

Usage: pgen projectname [subfile(s)] [-c] [-cpp] [-h] [-m] [-f] [-i]

projectname: Name of the project, which will be used as the main source file in the program

subfiles: Names of each subfile which should be generated by the program

-c: Tells the program to create .c source files for the project, and handle .c source files in the makefile.

-cpp: Tells the program to create .cpp source files for the project, and handle .cpp source files in the makefile.

-h: Tells the program to make .h files for each source file in the project.

-f: Tells the program to force overwrite any existing files with required names in the directory. If this flag is unchecked, previously defined files with same names will be ignored.
